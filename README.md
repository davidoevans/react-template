This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  It uses Babel
so ES6 and JSX can be used in Javascript code.

To run other parts of environment:

Start simple-express-server-master
nodemon server.js

Go to peoplelist project
truffle console # for interacting with testrpc

I think this can be run from anywhere?
testrpc # for local Ethereum platform
