# react-template

I developed this project while taking Mark Price's [React and Flux Web Development](https://www.udemy.com/react-flux/learn/v4/content) course on Udemy.

In addition, I bootstrapped this project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  

It uses Babel so ES6 and JSX can be used in Javascript code.

To run other parts of environment:

In my development environment, I'm Start simple-express-server-master
nodemon server.js

Go to peoplelist project
truffle console # for interacting with testrpc
